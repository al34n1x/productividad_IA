# 🧠 Introduction to AI and prompt engineering

Welcome to the first session of the **AI Productivity Course**. In this class, we’ll explore the foundations of Artificial Intelligence, how Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT work, and how to craft effective prompts to unlock their full potential.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

By the end of this session, you will:

- Understand what AI is and how it applies to productivity
- Learn the basics of how LLMs like ChatGPT operate
- Practice prompt engineering for real-life use cases
- Discover how to iterate and improve your results through better prompting

---

## 🧪 What Are LLMs?

LLMs (Large Language Models) are trained on massive datasets to understand and generate human-like text. ChatGPT is an example of a model built using the GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) architecture.

They’re powerful because they can:
- Answer questions
- Generate content
- Translate and summarize
- Write code, emails, reports, etc.

But they need **clear and specific prompts** to perform well — that’s where **prompt engineering** comes in.

## ✍️ Prompt Engineering Basics

| Prompt Type | Example |
|-------------|---------|
| Instructional | “Explain AI to a 12-year-old in 3 sentences.” |
| Role-based | “You are a project manager. Write a weekly status update.” |
| Format-specific | “Summarize the following in bullet points: [text]” |
| Comparative | “List pros and cons of using Zapier vs Make.com for automation.” |
| Iterative | “Improve this email for clarity and tone: [email]” |
