# 📝 Hands-On Project: Notion AI Task Generator

In this project, you'll learn to build a smart productivity dashboard inside Notion using **Notion AI** and templates.

---

## 🎯 Goal

Create a Notion workspace that:
- Uses AI to draft tasks based on project descriptions
- Summarizes meeting notes
- Suggests next actions automatically

---

## 🧱 Steps

### 1. Create a New Notion Page
- Title: `Smart Project Hub`
- Add a database called: `Tasks`

### 2. Add Key Properties
| Property | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| Name     | Title | Task name |
| Project  | Select | Name of the related project |
| Status   | Select | To do, In progress, Done |
| Notes    | Text   | AI-generated notes |
| AI Output | Text | This will hold AI suggestions |

---

### 3. Use Notion AI

Click into a task’s "AI Output" field and use these prompts:

- _"Based on this task title, suggest next steps."_
- _"Turn the notes into a 3-bullet task summary."_
- _"Prioritize this task based on urgency and complexity."_

---

## 💡 Optional Enhancements

- Create a synced calendar view
- Add a meeting notes section and let AI summarize your notes
